Hey!

## What is this?
Reddit has a special subrredit dedicated to the Tottenham Hotspur football club of the Premier League (https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/) that is comprised of 100K+ followers. Being a member of that community, and a huge fan of the club, I thought it would be cool and interesting to employ NLP techniques to explore the sentiment of the re-occuring match and post-match threads of the 2021-2022 season.

### *The following questions peaked my interest the most:*
 1. Can we identify different sentiment patterns for matches where the club won or lost?
 2. How does the sentiment differ in match threads as opposed to post-match threads?
 3. Does the match outcome has a lasting effect on the general sentiment of the subrredit?

I have used Reddit's API to retrieve comments from various thread types and than analyzed the average sentiment for each thread.
