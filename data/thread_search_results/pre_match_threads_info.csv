----------------------------------------
-""Imagine that Harry Kane does get on against Manchester City, the club he is desperate to join. How would he feel about denting their title hopes? How would Citys defenders feel about denting him? On the other hand, Kane could be keen to remind Pep Guardiola of his scoring prowess. Then again, is he in any shape to excel? Even the sight of him would draw a reaction from the Spurs crowd. In a game of many subplots, one transcends them all."" - David Hytner

-Manchester City won the Premier League last year.

-[Here's the match thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/myaaqd/match_thread_manchester_city_vs_tottenham_league/) from the last time Spurs played Man City, a 1-0 loss in the League Cup final.

### H2H

* Crystal Palace are without a victory in 12 Premier League meetings since a 2-1 win in January 2015.  
* Palace have won only one of their 16 league matches versus Spurs since returning to the Premier League in 2013.  
* Tottenham could earn a 13th top-flight away victory at Palace, the most by any club.

### Palace

 Wilfried Zaha has failed to register a goal or an assist in 12 Premier League games against Tottenham.  
* Jordan Ayew celebrates his 30th birthday on the day of this match. He has gone 30 Premier League appearances without a goal.

### Spurs

* Tottenham have started a league campaign with three wins and three clean sheets for the first time in their history. The only teams to have begun a top-flight campaign with four wins and no goals against are Aston Villa in 1900-01, Ipswich Town in 1974-75, Chelsea in 2005-06 and Manchester City in 2015-16.  
* On the two previous occasions in which Spurs started a season with three clean sheets (1924-25 and 2005-06), they lost 2-0 in their fourth game.  
* They are aiming to win their opening four top-flight matches to a season for only the fourth time. They last did so in 2009-10.  
* Nuno Espirito Santo is looking to become only the second manager to oversee a clean sheet in his opening four Premier League matches in charge of a club, emulating Joe Royle at Everton in 1994.  
* Tottenham have scored in 18 successive league fixtures, the longest current streak in the top flight.

### Chelsea

* Chelsea have only conceded one goal in the Premier League so far this season, their lowest total at this stage for 11 years.
* They could win six successive London derbies away from home for the first time in their history. It has only been done by one other top-flight club: Arsenal, between 1988-1989 and again in 2013-2014.
* The Blues' defeat at Aston Villa in May is their only loss in 11 Premier League away matches under Thomas Tuchel.

## Tottenham Hotspur

* Back-to-back 3-0 defeats leave Spurs at risk of losing three consecutive league matches by three goals or more for the first time in their history.
* They have been beaten in their last three Premier League games against fellow London clubs - they have not lost four in a row since a six-match sequence between March 2003 and January 2004.

-	Tottenham haven't won any of their last four League Cup games against fellow Premier League sides (D2 L2), though they did progress on penalties following the two draws in this run.

-	Burnley's Jay Rodriguez has been directly involved in 19 goals in his last 20 League Cup appearances (16 goals, 3 assists). This run has been over the last 10 years, and started and ended with four-goal hauls (vs Burton in August 2011 and Rochdale in the last round).

-	Tottenham's Heung-Min Son has been directly involved in six goals in his last six starts in the League Cup (4 goals, 2 assists).

**Spurs Team News:** **Matt Doherty** is back fit after an injury he picked up on international duty with the Republic of Ireland, leaving **Ryan Sessegnon** (hamstring) as the only injured player.

**Burnley:** **Maxwel Cornet**, who scored twice in the 2-2 draw at Southampton on Saturday, came off with cramp and is unlikely to be used. **Ben Mee** could be in contention after his bout of coronavirus but **Dale Stephens** is still some way from being match ready, despite being back in training.

*Antonio Conte received a crash course in life at Tottenham during a chaotic home debut against Vitesse on Thursday but three goals, renewed vigour in the final third and a public endorsement from Harry Kane give him something to build on in his first Premier League game in charge. His new club have not lost a Premier League game at Goodison Park in nine years and, despite their recent form, will sense an opportunity to extend that run to a decade against an Everton team that have lost three successive matches and remain without their first-choice spine.* - **Andy Hunter, The Guardian**

----

**Match Facts**

***Head-to-head***

-	Tottenham have won 27 Premier League games against Everton, more than against any other side.
-	Everton's only victory in the past 17 league meetings came at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last season.
-	Spurs are unbeaten on their last eight top-flight visits to Goodison Park.

***Everton***

-	Everton are aiming to avoid a fourth straight league defeat for the first time since October 2019.
-	Rafael Benitez could equal his longest Premier League losing streak as a manager, set on three occasions while at Newcastle.
-	A 10th defeat of 2021 at Goodison Park would match the club record for most home losses in a calendar year, set in 1929, 1958 and 1993.

***Tottenham Hotspur***

-	Antonio Conte is the fourth person to manage Spurs and Chelsea in the Premier League, emulating Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Jose Mourinho.
-	Villas-Boas is the only one of Spurs' last seven managers (including caretakers) not to win their first Premier League match in charge of the club.
-	Tottenham have only scored nine league goals this season, their fewest after 10 games since 2013-14.
-	Spurs haven't had a shot on target in their last two hours and 16 minutes of football since a Harry Kane effort in the 44th minute against West Ham.

*Will the real Harry Kane please stand up? The striker helped himself to seven goals in two games during the international break but his feats for England are in stark contrast to his club form, with Kane having only scored once in the Premier League for Tottenham this season. Antonio Conte will be desperate to lift Tottenhams talisman out of the malaise he has been in since a move to Manchester City failed to materialise during the summer and a Leeds defence which has conceded 18 goals could help him achieve that*. - **Stephen Hollis, The Guardian**

#####**Match Facts**

**Head-to-head**

* Tottenham have won their last four home league meetings with Leeds.

* This is their 100th meeting in all competitions, with Spurs ahead by 37 wins to Leeds' 33.

**Tottenham Hotspur**

* Tottenham could equal their club record of four league games without a goal for the first time since 2006.

* Spurs have managed just nine goals in the league in 2021-22 - only bottom side Norwich have scored fewer.

* At the same stage last season, Son Heung-min had scored 10 league goals and Harry Kane had eight.

* This season, Kane has scored just once in 10 Premier League appearances. In all competitions, he has gone five consecutive Spurs games without a goal for the first time since 2016.

* Tottenham have benefitted from four own goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League side.

**Leeds United**

* Leeds have gone three league games without defeat for the first time this season (W1, D2).

* Marcelo Bielsa's side have not kept a clean sheet in any of their five top-flight away matches so far.

* Leeds have drawn five Premier League matches in 2021-22, as many as they did in the whole of last season.

* Raphinha has scored 45% of Leeds' goals in the Premier League this season (five of 11), opening the scoring in a joint-high four matches.

Dean Smith has guided Norwich to five points from three games  riches compared to five from 11 matches under Daniel Farke  while Tottenham have collected seven from a possible nine since Antonio Conte took over from Nuno Espírito Santo. Both sides have yet to convince though, meaning the outcome is hard to call.
